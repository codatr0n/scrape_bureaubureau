# Scrape bureaubureau.dk
Webscraper for industry website www.bureaubureau.dk

I'm currently looking for work as a developer, so I thought a clever way to approch this was to start by building a webscraper to scrape the Danish industry website www.bureaubureau.dk for web agencies.

Running the `scrape.py` produces `agencies.json` file with all agencies and including focus areas of expertise and related tags for later processing.
